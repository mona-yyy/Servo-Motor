# Servo-Motor
I used tinkercad online website to design circuit with five servos and aurduino, 

The servo have three connections (power, ground, signal) which are provided by the arduino,The multiple servos 

using a breadboard to expand the arduino connections to all the exsisiting servos.
and I Identify the moving of servos 90 degrees.
